Day 2

String vs &str type differences
Efficient string parsing with lines() and split_ascii_whitespace()
Memory management using clone()
Tagged loop control with 'outer syntax
Conditional logic optimization



âœ¨ feat: Complete Day 2 challenges with Rust language features

- Implement solution using string manipulation and control flow features
- Learn and apply Rust-specific concepts: String vs &str, lines(), tagged loops
- Utilize convenient methods: lines() and split_ascii_whitespace()
- Practice memory management with clone() operations

Key learnings:
- Explored differences between String and &str types
- Discovered efficient string parsing methods
- Implemented tagged loop breaks with 'outer syntax
- Gained hands-on experience with Rust's ownership system
